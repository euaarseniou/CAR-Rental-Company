## Car Rental Company 

## Description of the Case:

A car rental company (let's call it CRC) wants to develop a relational database to monitor customers, rentals, fleet and locations. CRC's fleet consists of cars of different types. A car is described via a unique code (VIN), a description, color, 
brand, model, and date of purchase. A car may belong to one (exactly one) vehicle category (compact, economy, convertible, etc.). Each category is described by a unique ID, a label and a detailed description. CRC has several 
locations around the globe. Each location has a unique ID, an address (street, number, city, state, country) and one or more telephone numbers. CRC also keeps data about its customers. A customer is described by a unique 
ID, SSN, Name (First, Last), email, mobile phone number and lives in a state and country. Customers rent cars. A car rental has a unique reservation number, an amount (the value of the rental), the pickup and the return date. 
The car is picked up from a location and returned to another location (not necessarily the same.)
